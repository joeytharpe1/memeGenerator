# Meme generator

This project was creatd using react and material ui

## description

This app was created to showcase my skills using a api. The point here was to take a list of memes and have them render to the page randomly with a click of a button. The hardest part about this project was how to show only a single meme on the app. Making a variable that holds the meme url i was able to map through the api pictures, then make another variable that would only output a single meme image using the Math.random method.
